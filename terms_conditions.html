            <br>
            <p>Welcome to Duteko! Duteko is a platform that connects people who need to send packages with independent delivery providers. By using Duteko, you agree to these Terms of Use ("Terms").</p>

            <p>1.2. By using Duteko, you agree to these Terms and the separate Terms of Use (collectively, the "Duteko Terms of Use").</p>
            <p>1.3. We may update these Terms from time to time for legal or business reasons. We will give you reasonable notice of any changes. If you don't agree to the changes, you can stop using Duteko.</p>
            <p>1.4. By continuing to use Duteko, you agree to any changes.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>2. Using Duteko</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>2.1. You can only use Duteko for lawful purposes.</p>
            <p>2.2. You are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Properly preparing, sealing, and closing your Packages for safe delivery.</li>
                <li>Following our rules about prohibited items, package restrictions, and community guidelines (see below).</li>
                <li>Insuring your Packages if you want coverage.</li>
                <li>Taking full responsibility for your Packages during and after delivery, including damage due to temperature or tampering.</li>
                <li>Any loss, liability, or expense we incur due to your misuse of Duteko or a delivery provider's services.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2.3. Prohibited Items: You cannot use Duteko to send (i) illegal items; (ii) firearms, weaponry, ammunition, and their parts; (iii) batteries; (iv) highly perishable food or beverages (e.g., raw meat or dairy products); (v) pharmaceutical products, over-the-counter medications, vitamins or supplements; (vi) recreational drugs, drug paraphernalia, or tobacco products; (vii) money, gift-cards, lottery tickets or transferable securities; (viii) dangerous and hazardous items, including explosives, corrosives, items that are poisonous or flammable, medical waste, environmental waste, infectious substances and other dangerous or hazardous items as described in applicable law; (ix) stolen goods; (x) fragile items; (xi) obscene publications and unlawful indecent images; (xii) animals, and (xiii) alcohol.

            <p>2.7. Deliveries, Redeliveries, and Undelivered Packages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a delivery cannot be completed (e.g., the recipient cannot be found), the provider may try to return the Package to you.</li>
                <li>If the Package cannot be returned, it may be left at the original pickup location, another location you choose, or the delivery location (or somewhere safe nearby), as agreed with the provider.</li>
                <li>We will try to help you rearrange delivery or return undelivered Packages.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for any reasonable costs associated with returning, redelivering, or disposing of your Package, unless it's due to the provider's fault. We may pay these costs on the provider's behalf and recover the money from you using your payment method on file.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>2.8. Payment: You can only pay for deliveries using a digital payment method on file. We do not accept cash.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>3. Liability</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>3.1. Nothing in these Terms limits our liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, fraud, or fraudulent misrepresentation. These Terms also don't affect your consumer rights under applicable law.</p>

            <p>We may terminate these Terms or discontinue Duteko at any time with reasonable notice, unless there are serious grounds not to give notice, in which case we will notify you as soon as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>5. Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
